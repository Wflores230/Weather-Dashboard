# Weather-Dashboard

## Description 
This file contains everything you need to see a fully functional weather app using the Open Weather API. You will be able to search for any city name and once you hit search it will give you the current weather and a 5 day forcast. You will be displayed a try again alert if the city you typed in isn't an actually city. 

## Experiance
First time working with Open weather API and it was somewhat diffcult at first, but with help from friends and other coders, I was able to do use it to the best of my ability. I was able to use it to determine the forcast in certain areas of the world and display the weather icons as well. It was pretty diffcult but with pratice and determination I can get better.
